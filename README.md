## AdminTools

A basic Extra for MODx Revolution Administrators. It adds some features:
- favorites elements to the elements tree for each user individually.
- log of the edited elements (add button to the topbar of the elements tree).
- remember the system setting filters for each user individually.
- switched off check the elements permissions for users with sudo while building the tree. It reduces building time from 0,43s to 0,03s and used memory from 6.5Mb to 5.2Mb on my test site.

All settings store in cache folder (/core/cache/admintools/).
That's not all.
