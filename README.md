## AdminTools

A basic Extra for MODx Revolution Administrators. It adds some features:
- favorites elements to the elements tree.
- log of the edited elements (add button to the topbar of the elements tree).
- remember the system setting filters.
- switched off check the elements permissions for users with sudo while building the tree. It reduces building time from 0,43s to 0,03s and used memory from 6.5Mb to 5.2Mb on my test site.

That's not all.
