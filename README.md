## AdminTools

A basic Extra for MODx Revolution Administrators. It adds some features:
- favorites elements to the elements tree (for each user individually).
- log of the edited elements (add a button to the topbar of the elements tree).
- remember the last system settings filter (for each user individually).
- switched off check the permissions for users with sudo while building the tree. It reduces building time of the tree from 0,43s to 0,03s and amount of used memory from 6.5Mb to 5.2Mb on my test site.

All these features can be switched off by the corresponding system setting.

All features data are stored in cache folder (/core/cache/admintools/).  
That's not all.
